Web is filled with LLM generated trash. Looking all too similar, with too many hallucinations, with no real value. I am fed up of web having the same content regurgitated by everyone. Are these people writing for Humans to read or just for the sake of having content on the web?

Reading anything which resembles LLM generated text gives me the ick. It immediately loses credibility. I'd rather read some experts content with not so good writing than a noob with no new knowledge with perfect english.

LLMs have reduced the entry barrier for people to start writing, and this isn't always a good thing. What this now means is anyone can write by writing a prompt even though they don't have any real knowledge. Without LLMs you had to think a lot before writing anything but now anyone can just generate content in order to create credibility on web. One common users of LLMs are company marketing departments, they just create hollow content in order to drive more leads.

Human written prose (not written by a professional writer) might not look that pretty or professional but writing raw is now a vanity. Writing without LLMs has its own charm and I believe writing without LLMs will be more valuable as the world moves to using more LLMs.
