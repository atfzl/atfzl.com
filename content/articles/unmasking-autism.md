- Autism is a disability which cannot be cured
	- Autistic people have to accept it and live accordingly.
	- They should try to frame their life according to their disability. It could be the flexibility at their workplace, how their home is organized etc.
- People with Autism have diverse symptoms
    - Not comfortable in loud environments but some may need over stimulation.
    - Emotionally dissonant.
    - Not able to understand social cues.
    - Not able to make eye contact.
    - They are straightforward, outspoken and overtly analytical.
    - Called robotic by people.
- Normal people are able to gloss over details and see the big picture but autistic people are not able to ignore the details
	- This is sometimes a good thing, to be focused on details.
	- But sometimes they are fixated on small things which are better ignored because they might not be that important.
- How to help autistic people
	- Understand that the symptoms are not something which can be cured although autistic people usually mask them by appearing to be normal.
  - Give space for autistic people to be themselves and not require them to be seem normal.
  - Masking requires a lot of energy so if they don't have to mask it then they can spend that energy elsewhere.
  - Some autistic people are high functioning and don't required much support but some do.
  - High functioning Autism was known as Aspergers Syndrome.
- Some Autistic people representation on TV
	- The Big Bang Theory
	- Rain Man
	- Queens Gambit
	- Rick and Morty
	- Amelie
