# Using iTerm triggers

iTerm triggers can be used for converting text in your terminal to URLs and make them clickable. This is useful for creating JIRA issue links whenever there is a `JIRA-1234` like pattern.

## Steps: 

Go to 
`iTerm -> Preferences -> Profiles -> Advanced -> Triggers Edit`

![iterm preference](./_iterm_screenshot.png)

Add an entry in the table

```
Regular Expression: (?i)JIRA-\d+
Action:             Make Hyperlink
Parameters:         https://jira.yourhost.com/jira/browse/\0Â¯
```

![table](./_table.png)

Now whenever there is a pattern with `JIRA-1234`, it will become a clickable hyperlink.
