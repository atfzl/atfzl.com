<li>Autism is a disability which cannot be cured
<ul>
<li>Autistic people have to accept it and live accordingly.</li>
<li>They should try to frame their life according to their disability. It could be the flexibility at their workplace, how their home is organized etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People with Autism have diverse symptoms
<ul>
<li>Not comfortable in loud environments but some may need over stimulation.</li>
<li>Emotionally dissonant.</li>
<li>Not able to understand social cues.</li>
<li>Not able to make eye contact.</li>
<li>They are straightforward, outspoken and overtly analytical.</li>
<li>Called robotic by people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Normal people are able to gloss over details and see the big picture but autistic people are not able to ignore the details
<ul>
<li>This is sometimes a good thing, to be focused on details.</li>
<li>But sometimes they are fixated on small things which are better ignored because they might not be that important.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to help autistic people
<ul>
<li>Understand that the symptoms are not something which can be cured although autistic people usually mask them by appearing to be normal.</li>
<li>Give space for autistic people to be themselves and not require them to be seem normal.</li>
<li>Masking requires a lot of energy so if they don&rsquo;t have to mask it then they can spend that energy elsewhere.</li>
<li>Some autistic people are high functioning and don&rsquo;t required much support but some do.</li>
<li>High functioning Autism was known as Aspergers Syndrome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some Autistic people representation on TV
<ul>
<li>The Big Bang Theory</li>
<li>Rain Man</li>
<li>Queens Gambit</li>
<li>Rick and Morty</li>
<li>Amelie</li>
